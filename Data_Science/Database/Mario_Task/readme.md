# Explanation:
## JOINs: 
I replaced the implicit joins (using commas in FROM) with explicit JOIN statements, which are generally considered clearer and more efficient.

Result is joined with Track and Player based on the corresponding fields.
Player is joined with GameCharacter based on the character choice.
WHERE clause: The conditions check whether Player 1 or Player 2 won, and only the corresponding player is selected. This ensures you get the correct players based on who won.

## Tables:

Track: Contains information about tracks.
GameCharacter: Contains the character information.
Player: Contains player details and their chosen character.
Result: Tracks which player won on which track.
